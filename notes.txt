# Unordered Notes

## Memorymanagement

* Physical Memory and Virtual Memory has to be organised, using different algorithms
  - Physical Memory -> Data Structure lives as long as the OS is running
  - Virtual Memory -> Data Structure exists for Program in user space (i think?)



# OS Theory / Background (https://wiki.osdev.org/Category:OS_theory)

## Common Algorithms (https://wiki.osdev.org/Category:Common_Algorithms)

* CRC32 as Hashing algorithm
* Dithering (Graphical OS)
* Page Frame Allocation (Physical Memory, Virtal Memory, Memory Algorithms)
* Random Number Generator
* Scheduling Algorithms
